## Development Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
    - Windows users will also install WSL 2 (a Linux subsystem that runs on Windows) as part of this process.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Add a `.env` file at the root of the repo.
3. Add ENV vars to the `.env` file.
    - `AIRFLOW_UID=<uid>` - UID can be found by running `id -u` on linux systems, typically the first user on the system is `1000` or `1001`.
        - Windows users following the Docker Desktop install guide should have WSL 2 installed.  You can open up command line, type `wsl` and then within WSL 2, you can enter `id -u` to see your UID.
    - `UMLS_API=<umls_api_key>` - if you want to use RxNorm, you need an API key from UMLS (https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login).
4. Make sure Docker is installed (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
5. Run `docker-compose up airflow-init`.
6. Run `docker-compose up`.

> NOTE: if you have an [M1 Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62807717/how-can-i-solve-postgresql-scram-authentication-problem) `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`, and re-build your images

## Server URLs

- Airflow UI is hosted on `localhost:8001` or `0.0.0.0:8001`
    - Username/password = `airflow` / `airflow`
- PgAdmin is hosted on `localhost:8002` or `0.0.0.0:8002`
    - Username/password = `sagerx` / `sagerx`

## Using dbt

On `docker-compose up` a dbt container will be created to be used for cli commands. To enter commands run `docker exec -it dbt /bin/bash`. This will place you into a bash session in the dbt container. Then you can run dbt commands as you normally would.

## Troubleshooting

If you get issues on folder permissions:

`sudo chmod -R 777 postgres,data,extracts,logs,plugins`
